# 🧠 AI Story Generator (Practice Project)

This is a beginner-friendly practice project to learn how to build an **AI-powered story generator** using:

- ✅ HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- 🧠 [OpenAI (ChatGPT)](https://platform.openai.com/)
- 🧠 [Anthropic (Claude)](https://console.anthropic.com/)

The frontend sends a prompt to an AI API (not live yet) and receives a generated story in return.

> ⚠️ **No real API key is included in this repo.**  
> This is a learning project only — not deployed or production-ready.

---

## 💡 How It Works (Planned Logic)

1. User types a story prompt
2. The app sends it to OpenAI/Claude
3. It returns a short story
4. The story is displayed in the browser

---

## 🧪 Status

- [x] Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS done  
- [ ] Backend/API Integration (Coming soon)  
- [ ] Live Deployment (Optional)
